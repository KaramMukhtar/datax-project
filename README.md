# datax-project


All of our work is in the "gentrification_project" directory, within the "model_final.ipynb" notebook. 
All the data that we used for our project is at the same path, inside the folder "data". We have left other pieces 
of our project and work done in the directory, just as a track record of the avenues we tried before pivotting our
focus in this project.

We hope that you find our work meaningful, please reach out to us if you have any questions!
